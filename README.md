# Voxel Pomodoro 🏗️⏱️

A high-performance 3D productivity tool that turns your focus sessions into a creative building experience.

## What is Voxel Pomodoro?
Voxel Pomodoro is a "focus-to-build" application. Instead of just watching a progress bar, you watch a 3D sculpture assemble itself block-by-block as you work.

### Core Features
- **The Pomodoro Cycle:** Choose between **Work** (25m) and **Break** (5m) sessions.
- **Dynamic Assembly:** Models dismantle when a session starts and progressively rebuild as the timer counts down.
- **AI-Powered Creativity:** Use the "Prompt a build" feature to generate unique voxel sculptures using Gemini 3 Pro.
- **Gallery of Presets:** Quick-start with high-quality presets like the Eagle, Cat, or Rabbit.
- **Portable Blueprints:** Export and import your creations using a simple JSON format.

## How to Use
1. **Choose a Build:** Select a preset from the **Builds** menu or create a new one with a text prompt.
2. **Start Session:** Click the big **START SESSION** button at the bottom.
3. **Focus:** The sculpture will begin assembling from the ground up.
4. **Completion:** When the timer hits zero, the sculpture is finalized and snaps into its high-fidelity state.
5. **Manage:** Use the timer controls in the top bar to pause, resume, or reset your current session.

## Controls
- **Left Click + Drag:** Rotate the camera.
- **Right Click + Drag:** Pan the camera.
- **Scroll:** Zoom in and out.
- **Auto-Rotate:** Toggle the automatic rotation in the top right menu for a cinematic view.
